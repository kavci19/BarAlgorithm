# BarAlgorithm

This project in progress seeks to employ several trading algorithms to detect the best times to enter and leave the market. Live data is pulled from TD Ameritrade every minute via HTTP GET requests and Websockets and fed into the different functions. When a great investment opportunity is found, the user is notified via a windows notification and live phone notifications.
